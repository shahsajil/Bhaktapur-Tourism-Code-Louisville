# Bhaktapur-Tourism-Code-Louisville
This is a class project named as Bhaktapur Tourism which I have posted in my repository name Bhaktapur Tourism Code Louisville. As I am a student of Front end Developer we need to make one project at the end of session in order to pass the requirement of Code Louisville. In this project, I have included custom CSS, custom JS, Bootstrap Framework. I also tried to make it more responsive design using a framework such as bootstrap and using some other interactivity functionalities like slick slider to slide the image, lightbox that pops up a image, Bootstrap Modal and one custom modal using JavaScript. In future time, I am hoping this project will be very useful resources to the beginners as I have made some useful comments in the major sections of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
